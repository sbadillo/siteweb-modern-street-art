# -- Collections 

# When you create a Hugo site, the default content type is post. Writing “hugo new post blog-1” will create a new post for you, named “blog-1”. So let’s setup our first collection for the post type.

collections:
  - name: "home-section" # Used in routes, e.g., /admin/collections/blog
    label: "home-section" # Used in the UI
    folder: "content" # The path to the folder where the documents are stored
    create: true # Allow users to create new documents in this collection
    slug: "{{slug}}" # Filename template, e.g., YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
    fields: # The fields for each document, usually in front matter
      - {label: "Title", name: "title", widget: "string"}
      - {label: "Publish Date", name: "date", widget: "datetime"}
      - {label: "Body", name: "body", widget: "markdown"}
      - {label: "Order", name: "weight", widget: "number"}
      - {label: "Image", name: "image", widget: "string"}
